# 42_philosophers
This project is about learning how to use threads and mutexes   

## TODOs   
- Check valid input (at least one digit per arg) (ft_atoi returns 0)
- No messages printing after each philo is eating (if using ft_usleep)
- Stop simulation right after one philo dies

## Links
- Threads vs processes [link](https://medium.com/@jalal92/lets-discuss-threads-grab-a-coffee-ad4d4ebf7181).
