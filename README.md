# 42_philosophers
This project is about learning how to use threads and mutexes   
## Workflow   
- Check valid input (at least one digit per arg)
- Create int array with forks?
- Create mutex array, one for each fork
- Linked list for philosophers. Each philosopher is a node (with an int representing its number and an int array of 2 elements with the forks it can use)?
- Protect printf with mutex
- Create more precise usleep
- Create system for what fork each philo should pick up first, and if it checks both forks
